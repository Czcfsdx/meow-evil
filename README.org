#+title: Meow

* Introduction

[[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][Meow]] is a great modal editing mode for Emacs. I love it's concept: using kmacro for normal mode keybind, keypad inspired by [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode][god-mode]], select before execute an action which is more like [[https://kakoune.org/][kakoune]] ...

But it is too hard for me (come from a Vim background) to be adapted to it. So I forked Mewo and try to make it more 'evil' (as many emacs user know, [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][evil]] is just like vim in emacs)

However, different people have different understanding of vim and emacs. So it may not 'evil' in other people opinions. Emacs is free, welcome to create your version of mewo-evil.
