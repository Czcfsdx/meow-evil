#+title: Meow

* Introduction

[[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][Meow]] is a great modal editing mode for Emacs. I love it's concept: using kmacro for normal mode keybind, keypad inspired by [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/god-mode][god-mode]], select before execute an action which is more like [[https://kakoune.org/][kakoune]] ...

But it is too hard for me (come from a Vim background) to be adapted to it. So I forked it and make my version of meow
